-Thanks to Brant Barger, Blaise Thomas, Alexis Gormly, and Brandon Kwong for all their help and patience with me. Definitely not at their level right now but through this collab I've learned so much, more than if I were to have tried to do this on my own.-

We decided to make the board scaleable. Board size and win condition (how many in a row) can be edited. Board works, win logic works. I will fork from Brant's repo as well but I will try to add my own features and style on my repo.

My idea so far:
-Based on difficulty level, add a landmine to specified board size, min board size is 8x8
  Easy: 1 random landmine to win 4 in a row
  Medium: 2 random landmines to win 4 in a row
  Hard: 3 random landmines to win 4 in a row
  
Will edit this as I go along.

-Cris
